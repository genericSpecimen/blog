This is a general purpose blog meant for documenting the things I learn and some posts would also double as tutorials.


I started programming at the age of 16. Before that, I had a keen interest in Physics, which gradually faded since the computing world had already gotten a hold of my mind. I'm a free and open source software advocate. Here are some of the GitHub repositories I have created:

* [**arch_i3_rice**](https://github.com/genericspecimen/arch_i3_rice): My dotfiles for the system I have configured to suit my daily workflow needs. I use [Arch Linux](https://www.archlinux.org/) with the [i3](https://i3wm.org/) tiling window manager. 
* [**DU_Crawl**](https://github.com/genericspecimen/DU_Crawl): A small project that I made to download the results of my classmates in College. I used [Scrapy](https://scrapy.org/) to fetch results for each student by inputting the roll number and college name. I downloaded the resulting .html files and crawled through these files to generate a .csv file containing the result of all my classmates.

This blog is created using the [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) static site generator and by modifying the [hugo-kiera](https://github.com/avianto/hugo-kiera) theme to make it look the way I want. Huge thanks to the developers of these projects!
