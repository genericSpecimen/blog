This is a general purpose blog meant for documenting the things I learn.

## Earlier life
------
I started programming at the age of 16. My school introduced me to C++ (which actually was C, masqueraded as C++). Having almost zero prior experience in computer programming, it took me a lot of time to understand what was going on. Eventually, things started making sense and soon enough, I was quite interested in programming. I learned about the vastness of the computing world, and all the different domains of expertise. Needless to say, I was overwhelmed. Soon, I realized that no human can possibly learn all these things - _and achieve mastery in it_.


## Fast forward to today
------
These days, I'm learning about Linux, and I'm a Free/Libre and Open Source Software advocate. One area that I plan to get my hands on is Web Development. I haven't been able to explore Web Development yet, and I feel it is an important field to have knowledge about. Other than that, here are some of my projects/repositories:

* [**github-scripts**](https://github.com/genericSpecimen/github-scripts): My experiments with the GitHub API to avoid opening the GitHub website to perform simple tasks.
* [**praw-scripts**](https://github.com/genericSpecimen/praw-scripts): Some scripts I wrote using PRAW: The Python Reddit API Wrapper.
* [**rice**](https://github.com/genericspecimen/rice): This repository contains dotfiles, scripts and some other things that were used by me to customize my system.
* [**result-crawler**](https://github.com/genericSpecimen/scrapy-scripts/tree/master/results): A project to automate the download of the results of my classmates from the university website. I used [Scrapy](https://scrapy.org/) to fetch results for each student by inputting the roll number and college name, and then saving the .html response into a file, and then crawl through these files to generate a .csv file containing the result of all my classmates.
* [**latex-résumé**](https://github.com/genericSpecimen/latex-resume): A résumé template made with [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/).
* [**competitive**](https://github.com/genericSpecimen/competitive): My attempts at competitive programming.

## About this blog
------
This blog is created using the [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) static site generator and by modifying the [hugo-kiera](https://github.com/avianto/hugo-kiera) theme to make it look the way I want. Huge thanks to the developers of these projects!
