> Android is an open source linux-based mobile operating system.

While this statement can be considered to be true, there's more to keep in mind. Android seems to be on it's way to becoming more and more of an proprietary operating system. The core operating system is a part of the AOSP (Android Open Source Project), but the majority of core applications are not a part of AOSP. This [arsTECHNICA](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2018/07/googles-iron-grip-on-android-controlling-open-source-by-any-means-necessary/) article is a good write-up on this issue and I recommend reading it.

From the [microG Project](https://microg.org/):

> More and more libraries and APIs are only available on phones that run various Google apps pre-installed, effectively locking third-party apps to the Google ecosystem. For these reasons Android is described as being a “look but don’t touch” kind of open.

The above mentioned [microG Project](https://microg.org/) is a project that aims to replace the Google’s proprietary core libraries and applications with a free-as-in-freedom software clone. This project can be used to spoof Google Play Services and for location services.

Let's take a look at some of the other FOSS Android Application alternatives. These have zero ads, contain zero bullshit, and get straight to work.
